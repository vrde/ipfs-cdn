        During its 24th close flyby of Jupiter, NASA&apos;s Juno spacecraft captured
        this view of a chaotic, stormy area of the planet&apos;s northern hemisphere
        known as a folded filamentary region. Jupiter has no solid surface in
        the same way Earth does. Data collected by Juno indicate that some of
        the giant planet&apos;s winds run deeper and last longer than similar
        atmospheric processes on Earth.

        iss061e150268 (Jan. 31, 2020) --- The Cygnus space freighter from
        Northrop Grumman is pictured departing the vicinity of the International
        Space Station after its release from the Canadarm2 robotic arm. Cygnus
        had completed an 88-day stay attached to the Unity module after
        delivering nearly 8,200 pounds of research and supplies to space station
        on Nov. 4, 2019.

        Just 15 minutes after its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015,
        NASA&#x2019;s New Horizons spacecraft looked back toward the sun and captured
        this near-sunset view of the rugged, icy mountains and flat ice plains
        extending to Pluto&#x2019;s horizon. The smooth expanse of the informally named
        icy plain Sputnik Planum (right) is flanked to the west (left) by rugged
        mountains up to 11,000 feet (3,500 meters) high, including the
        informally named Norgay Montes in the foreground and Hillary Montes on
        the skyline. To the right, east of Sputnik, rougher terrain is cut by
        apparent glaciers. The backlighting highlights over a dozen layers of
        haze in Pluto&#x2019;s tenuous but distended atmosphere. The image was taken
        from a distance of 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) to Pluto; the scene
        is 780 miles (1,250 kilometers) wide.
